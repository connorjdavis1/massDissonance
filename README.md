# massDissonance

To Do:

1. Create new R project and clean my code!
	- Mainly, create function for model so it isn't so long
	- Eliminate anything that isn't actually used such as my toying with data
	- add "wl" separaters and comments so the code actually makes sense to me later this week

2. Upload CSV files
3. Upload poster
4. Upload graphs
5. Make sure files are all organized before you share with not DB or DS
6. Edit this README explaining this project.
7. Make a bunch more repositories and then get a decent job
